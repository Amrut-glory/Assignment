Q14. What are operators in Python?
A.   Particular symbol which is responsible for particular action.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
A.   / is used for division of float data type.
     // is used for division of integer data type.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron

a = 4 * 'iNeuron'
print(a)
```

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

Number = int(input('Enter a Number'))
if Number % 2 == 0:
    print(Number, 'is a even number')
else:
    print(Number, 'is a odd number')

Q18. What are boolean operator?
A.   and, or, not

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 = 1

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

Age = int(input('Enter age = '))
if Age >= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I cant't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

num1 = int(input("Enter first number = "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number = "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third number = "))

if num1 > num2 and num1 > num3:
    print(num1, " is greatest")
elif num2 > num1 and num2 > num3:
    print(num2, " is greatest")
else:
    print(num3, " is greatest")


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
